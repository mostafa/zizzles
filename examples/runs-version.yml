# This file demonstrates runs version vulnerabilities that Zizzles can detect.
#
# CRITICAL RISK:
# - node12: End-of-life Node.js version (critical security vulnerability)
# - node10, node8, node6, node4: Very old unsupported versions
#
# HIGH RISK:  
# - node14: Deprecated Node.js version (no longer supported)
#
# MEDIUM RISK:
# - Unknown node versions (e.g., node99)
# - Missing 'using' field in JavaScript actions
#
# SAFE:
# - node16, node20, node21: Currently supported versions
# - docker: Docker-based actions
# - composite: Composite actions
#
# The file covers:
# - All deprecated and unsupported Node.js versions
# - Different severity levels
# - Missing version specifications
# - Supported versions (no alerts)
# - Non-Node.js actions (no alerts)
